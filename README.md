# Quest for the Orb of Quarkus

I made a simple flutter app where I used my backend API I made in Java

Game rule:

After entering your name, the backend will generate the entire game from Level 1 to Level 10.
Each level has randomly generated items and monsters. You can only take an item if you have defeated a monster.
You can escape from the monster but you lose all the items you took and your health is reduced.
When you defeat the last monster you need to take the last item - Orb of Quarkus. When you took the last item you won the game.
